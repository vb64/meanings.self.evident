1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:34,440
Speaker 1: well hello everyone today i am privileged to welcome uh i guess you've already seen on our channel jordan hall uh so there won't be too long of an introduction i just would mention that our last conversation i think provided a really important insight for many of you and that's why i decided to continue our calls and schedules, apart from my personal pleasure, which is always a huge element of these endeavors.

2
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,140
Speaker 1: And so, to do something short, very happy to see you, Jordan.

3
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,820
Speaker 1: Welcome on the channel.

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, thank you.

5
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:50,660
Speaker 0: We had a really nice conversation last time, and I got to discover afterwards that you have deployed AI to make me speak Russian, which was fun.

6
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,420
Speaker 0: Fun to hear myself speaking Russian.

7
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had to do it.

8
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,960
Speaker 1: And that's part of the point.

9
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:14,480
Speaker 1: It's not the easiest of endeavors, but building this type of bridges, I think, is important because there is so much deep thought beyond the news headlines happening in English language, which is inaccessible to Russian audience.

10
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:43,720
Speaker 1: vice versa like almost none of the russian speaking conversations are really translated well into english and like just going completely on the radar so these conversations are like a small contribution contributions to provide more volume to provide more volume general substantial let's put it this way uh not debates but conversations on the key crucial topics and speak of crucial topics.

11
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:50,440
Speaker 1: So today we are going to speak a little on a first glance about a little bit more mundane problems.

12
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,000
Speaker 1: It will jump from the post you've written recently and I will ask you to summarize.

13
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:04,280
Speaker 1: But we will talk about politics, about the relationship between different elements of political, how it's organized right now and why this conversation is important.

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,620
Speaker 1: So without further ado, please go on.

15
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,680
Speaker 1: Well,

16
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:36,340
Speaker 0: maybe as just a bit of background, particularly for those who are coming from the Russian civilization, I am an example of something that is a big part of the Western tradition, but has been largely extinguished for the past 50 or 80 years, which is I am not a credentialed expert in anything.

17
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,460
Speaker 0: Instead, what I did is I made my own way in entrepreneurship, specifically in technology.

18
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,080
Speaker 0: And this afforded me two things.

19
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,160
Speaker 0: Well, three things, really.

20
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:58,520
Speaker 0: It afforded me a certain practice and training in using the intellect to engage with physical reality in a highly competitive environment, which is not the same thing as how the academy works.

21
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,020
Speaker 0: It afforded me the opportunity then to use the rest of my life to do whatever I thought was the best thing to do.

22
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,580
Speaker 0: instead of being governed by the exigencies of making money.

23
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:24,320
Speaker 0: And it afforded me the access, the ability to access a wide variety of different people with either inside information or deep expertise or profound capacities, which I have taken significant advantage of.

24
00:03:26,940 --> 00:04:07,360
Speaker 0: One consequence is that, and this... very very specifically was highlighted in 2016 is that on occasion when an event occurs that is very surprising to a large number of people or perhaps even more than surprising the word would be confounding um a number of people who i know will ask me what is my perspective on what has happened and on occasion if that happens enough i get tired of repeating myself so i write it down And so this began a series of essays that I wrote back in 2017, endeavoring to make sense of the Trump election, which in the West was quite confounding to a very large number of people.

25
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,680
Speaker 0: And that became a very popular set of essays describing a certain way of thinking about things.

26
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,600
Speaker 0: And I haven't written these in quite some time, but recently, like in just about a week or two ago.

27
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,920
Speaker 0: a similar problem began to emerge in terms of this, what is going on with the Trump tariffs?

28
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,600
Speaker 0: And so I just sat down and just briefly sketched out a couple of ways of thinking about it.

29
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:45,880
Speaker 0: And so the idea here is first at a meta level, the methodology is differential analysis by means of a variety of frames.

30
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,400
Speaker 0: So you'll hear, I'll make a proposition of a way of looking at things.

31
00:04:51,220 --> 00:05:01,240
Speaker 0: And I'm not going to try to defend the way of looking at things as being the way reality is, but rather that it is a reasonably plausible way that reality is.

32
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,020
Speaker 0: And if you look through that lens, two things will happen.

33
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,440
Speaker 0: One is you'll be seeing reality the way that people who are operating by means of that lens see reality, which is very helpful.

34
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:25,700
Speaker 0: and second you'll add that perspective to your portfolio and then as you look through a variety of these lenses you'll have a higher dimensional perspective on what's happening and you'll be looking through the eyes of people perhaps that you don't uh agree with which can always be very helpful

35
00:05:26,480 --> 00:07:19,400
Speaker 1: i just want to add to this point why it's important and it's something i try to show like it's because it's not much about preaching this logically but like showing how it works people nowadays surprisingly to me uh even kind of who are supposed to do what you're describing by trade by profession kind of avoid like and run if you want to say it from this duty in a sense it's uh let's say a wrong way of viewing the world that's why we are not going to discuss it from its own perspective we're just gonna label it and then pretend it's not functioning which i always respond that's it's precisely then necessary for you to understand how this world view works or how this again worldview is a very soft term for this metric so it's more like a meta view so because no matter what you think about this meta version of reality it's important that people will act from their meta versions of reality so if you want to understand why somebody is doing something you need to understand what kind of world one is living in and you can absolutely sincere disagree with the world they live in or you can consider well it's madness it will lead to their own destruction which is totally fine with me but you can but nevertheless accept that they will act based upon it so you're not building this false expectations and then are constantly surprised how it's possible to happen it was not supposed to have it's self-evident that should not happen it's happening nevertheless and that's what i think you're talking about It just, again, you absolutely right mentioned, I think in the Western culture, it was Trump election definitely became this like revolutionary moment from this perspective, because it was the type of event which shouldn't have happened because it shouldn't have happened.

36
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,160
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.

37
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:30,580
Speaker 0: And just to add to the ones that I will articulate in a moment, I'm explicitly avoiding two things.

38
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,300
Speaker 0: One, I'm avoiding frames that are already common currency, because what's the point of that?

39
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,120
Speaker 0: Everybody already has them.

40
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:45,600
Speaker 0: And the second is I'm avoiding, in this particular case, any effort to try to model Trump's mind for two reasons.

41
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,680
Speaker 0: Again, this seems to be a favorite habit of people who typically are wrong.

42
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,460
Speaker 0: It's an interesting filter.

43
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,640
Speaker 0: And second, I've never seen anybody do it well, so it may not be a useful way of trying to do things.

44
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,640
Speaker 0: Okay, so here's some of the frames.

45
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:10,140
Speaker 0: So one frame is... One of the things that is happening in the world that is very important is the collapse of neoliberalism.

46
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:21,700
Speaker 1: Can you just quickly explore and so we certainly understand the same thing and the neoliberalism and the audience understands on it.

47
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,660
Speaker 1: So what do you put into neoliberalism?

48
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,840
Speaker 0: Well, it's actually a two-step process.

49
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,880
Speaker 0: So the first step is liberalism.

50
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,840
Speaker 0: So I understand neoliberalism as merely the logical consequence of liberalism.

51
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,400
Speaker 0: It's sort of the final form or the fully bloated form.

52
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,580
Speaker 0: And liberalism is a little bit difficult, but let's see if I can say it succinctly and accurately.

53
00:08:46,780 --> 00:09:06,840
Speaker 0: Liberalism is an effort to address the problem of the loss of faith in the West by means of producing a secular religion, that could enable coordination between groups of people that were perhaps operating under different religious worldviews.

54
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:07,860
Speaker 0: Okay.

55
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,260
Speaker 0: Go on.

56
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,660
Speaker 0: And we can go into more detail about why I modeled that as having a natural trajectory, but for the moment, that's that.

57
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,120
Speaker 1: Yeah.

58
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,360
Speaker 1: Let's just clarify it.

59
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,220
Speaker 1: And why it's so-so.

60
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:21,960
Speaker 1: Yeah.

61
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,240
Speaker 1: Thank you.

62
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,400
Speaker 1: Okay.

63
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:22,480
Speaker 1: uh

64
00:09:23,740 --> 00:10:02,780
Speaker 0: the second is the uh collapse of the american hegemony and i mean largely here notice that these two things are not exactly the same the american hegemony is has been put to the service of neoliberalism to a very great extent but it is not the same thing and what i mean is both at the military level that the United States is no longer actually able to have fully asymmetric power projection and either will be hubristically getting itself involved into conflicts that it can't win or will be noticing that it needs to not engage in conflicts that it can't win, which is going to be a big difference in the nature of reality.

65
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,280
Speaker 0: Huh, interesting.

66
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,080
Speaker 0: I've forgotten the third.

67
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,800
Speaker 0: Do you remember what it was?

68
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:08,900
Speaker 1: One sec.

69
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,720
Speaker 1: I think, yeah.

70
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,440
Speaker 1: I think... uh you mentioned that civilizations are unstable

71
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:27,240
Speaker 0: oh that's well that's a different that's a different post but we can do that too yeah um so let me get to the get to the last one on um oh the fourth industrial revolution

72
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,140
Speaker 1: so the

73
00:10:30,000 --> 00:11:33,500
Speaker 0: next one is that um industrial revolutions seem to be a real thing and that when we're moving through an industrial revolution it tends to have what's known as an s curve so there's a period of time where it's just beginning to happen then it becomes mature then it becomes the reality that we just live in and then it becomes uh senescent it becomes something old and so we're nearing the end of the last industrial revolution and nearing very much in the acceleration phase of the next industrial revolution and what that means is that a very large a fraction of our underlying um it's the kind of classic marx distinction the the infrastructure matters a lot and a lot of the infrastructure is in fact going to be replaced so as an example many people in in the left on the west have been projecting a mental model of the idea of the united states re-onshoring industry as being one of taking uh sweatshop machine shop factories from China and trying to place them in the United States.

74
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,740
Speaker 0: And of course, they look at that and say, that's absurd.

75
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,520
Speaker 0: Americans aren't going to work at $2 an hour.

76
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,980
Speaker 0: But the point is that that's meta absurd, because that's not the idea.

77
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:54,160
Speaker 0: The idea is replacing that entire category of industry with a completely new category of industry, which might be all robots, or it might be synthetic biology using fungi to synthetically produce sock-like objects.

78
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,360
Speaker 0: We're talking about a whole new category of industry that's completely different in how it operates.

79
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,360
Speaker 0: And this, by the way, has two very big implications.

80
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:11,940
Speaker 0: One implication is that the power structures that have been sitting on top of the third industrial revolution are going to be destabilized.

81
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:27,300
Speaker 0: And the other implication is a lot of our intuitions on how things, how energy flows and resources operate and how the flows of economy work are themselves going to be disrupted because the new industrial approaches operate in a different fashion.

82
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,320
Speaker 1: I would add to this even more basic category is disrupted, the category of value.

83
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,640
Speaker 1: Because any technological system provides its own hierarchy of value.

84
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,840
Speaker 1: And I'm speaking now purely about material and the skills level of value.

85
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,920
Speaker 1: And you are talking about basically a complete shift.

86
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:58,300
Speaker 1: in this whole value hierarchy and other subsequent hierarchy it produces, like hierarchy in education, hierarchy in social capital, hierarchy in migration.

87
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,920
Speaker 1: It's strengthening your point.

88
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, wonderful.

89
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, so let's bridge to the last one and then we can go to the previous post because these start to all go together.

90
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:12,200
Speaker 0: So the last one is a special case of the fourth industrial revolution is AI.

91
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:30,080
Speaker 0: And so one of the lenses that you can look through is to say, What's really happening, let's say, or a way of making sense of what's happening that is very important, is that a sizable number of global elites have identified the race to AI dominance as the only thing that matters.

92
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:41,580
Speaker 0: And so they, who are quite powerful and getting more powerful by the day, are looking at all of the other pieces on the board, let's use a chess metaphor, as tactical.

93
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,900
Speaker 0: I can sacrifice a lot of pawns if I ultimately am able to get the checkmate.

94
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:55,860
Speaker 0: And the thesis is, by the way, that this is a checkmate, that whoever achieves AI supremacy has such an asymmetric advantage over everybody else that it's a singleton.

95
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,640
Speaker 0: It's a one-time win.

96
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:07,040
Speaker 0: Now, again, you may not agree with that as an assessment, but as a model of what some number of powerful people are doing, I would assure you that it's useful.

97
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,600
Speaker 1: Oh, I absolutely agree.

98
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,140
Speaker 1: I agree that that's the world too.

99
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:20,100
Speaker 1: which I think became prominent, especially in the last three years, I would put, maybe slightly earlier, but really skyrocketed in the last three years.

100
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,440
Speaker 1: And I've seen basically Xi talking about it, Putin talked about importance of AI.

101
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,720
Speaker 1: In America, people talk about it.

102
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,240
Speaker 1: So it's not some intellectuals in a small room.

103
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,620
Speaker 1: It's become a point of power.

104
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,520
Speaker 1: I was kind of nodding in a sense, not disagreeing with that's how they see it.

105
00:14:40,120 --> 00:15:17,040
Speaker 1: disagree with the fact that it's a single thing like that's i think where i disagree i think i it's a part of ecology and a part of infrastructure but without understanding the let's say unity which can function in the ei environment and by unity i mean social unity political unity geographical unities even ai won't be this magical trump card sorry for play uh which many politicians think it is but that's my assessment as i agree with you in terms of picturing the understanding yes that's very clear now becoming key focus

106
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:35,140
Speaker 0: absolutely okay so then and then then moving on to the the other other post the one that i just articulated i actually wrote up as an essay the one that i'm about to give you some a summary of is i actually wrote as only a tweet but the basic idea is this um First, neoliberalism is imploding.

107
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:48,940
Speaker 0: Second, this will produce for a period of time the effect of the resurgence of what I in that tweet called civilization states, and I believe in your sphere this is a very common term.

108
00:15:50,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Speaker 0: Then I make my third point, which is, and surprisingly, my thesis is, is that civilizations writ large, are themselves also A, unstable, and B, at the end of their lifetime, which will then lead to the emergence of what I was calling nations without states.

109
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:09,560
Speaker 0: Yes.

110
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:18,260
Speaker 0: This is a very complex proposition, but this is the proposition I put out there, and then you and I had a little bit of a correspondence on it.

111
00:16:19,120 --> 00:18:40,240
Speaker 1: Yes, so I just want to start from here, and thanks for guest... no thanks but absolutely necessary context to understand what we are going to talk about right now because i want to clarify it with you uh what exactly do you mean by nation without states because um like cards like cartons are open i think the very concept of nation is very particular and not a universal concept which is conditioned on a very particular period of intellectual and social exactly value hierarchy within the european context of the let's say early starting from early 18th century and by no means is universal to humans or you would say different regions or different civilizations and we can go into it but i can bring quite a lot of examples that many fundamental assessments about nations which kind of became the foundation of nation type thinking are simply not working together like uh and not supported historically and it took a lot of let's say cutting to at least move reality at least a little bit towards the assumptions of the nation theory and when it comes to civilization as well like why do you think like what exactly do you mean by it's imploding and why do you think it's civilization which imploding and not uh nation nation not nations are imploding or not modernity are imploding because i think where we can more or less agree uh is that that political social governmental system produced by modernity per se are imploding and kind of all of the things you mentioned are just different sides of the similar problem like neoliberalism you can you can see neoliberalism as the pinnacle of modernity political so you can see american hegemony as a pinnacle of exactly this kind of modernistic because more modernistic geopolitical thought and it like there is a lot of writing in american sort of the last 50 years which was exactly like happy about like yeah finally we reach this pinnacle we will stay on this pinnacle forever not working ai revolution underlies not our just whole new technological revolution underlies the basic assumptions of modernity as Like industrial capitalism projects started in the 16th century.

112
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:55,020
Speaker 1: And we can remember some famous Max Weber, he's like, you know, Protestant ethics and the spirit of capitalism and then industrial revolutions of Netherlands and Britain and then later this model replicating itself and how it's this model per se is imploding right now.

113
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,580
Speaker 1: So all these things I think we're in agreement on that basic structure is imploding.

114
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,680
Speaker 1: But where we differ is like what has a chance of coming out of it.

115
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,420
Speaker 1: And that's why I want to.

116
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,240
Speaker 1: kind of direct our conversation towards this point.

117
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,360
Speaker 0: Great.

118
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:20,020
Speaker 0: So what I'll do is, I love having conversations with you because it's very rare that I can actually have a truly intellectual conversation, but we're going to have a truly intellectual conversation here.

119
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:33,020
Speaker 0: So on this hand, I want to talk about, I'll say that there's, from my point of view, a very deep distinction between what I'll be calling nation and civilization.

120
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:45,260
Speaker 0: And then I will say that all the various things that are variants on civilization, of which modernity, neoliberalism, and empire, all are variations of civilization.

121
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,380
Speaker 0: So the most basic distinction is just these two.

122
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:56,200
Speaker 0: So when I say nation, I actually mean two different things that are made quite compatible.

123
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:04,100
Speaker 0: Nation is on the one hand, something like family, or kin, or lineage.

124
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:12,680
Speaker 0: which is to say that it is a group that is held together on the basis of deep kinship and relationality.

125
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,780
Speaker 0: This is maybe the physical side.

126
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,980
Speaker 0: And then the other way of saying it is that it is a group that shares a common spirit.

127
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,340
Speaker 0: The spiritual side.

128
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:43,300
Speaker 0: And then when I say civilization, what I mean, and here we could maybe even just say Babylon, is a group that are brought together on the basis of a combination of coercion and incentive.

129
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:59,560
Speaker 0: And there's a visual image that I have is that I have something like sand and snow, where if I have a bunch of sand and let's say I wet it, I can squeeze it into something like a ball.

130
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,480
Speaker 0: but it is still at the end of the day an aggregate.

131
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,280
Speaker 0: And if and when the water dries out, the sand falls again back to dust.

132
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,580
Speaker 0: This is a civilization.

133
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,260
Speaker 0: If I have snow, when I squeeze it, the heat melts the snow into water, but the water freezes back into ice.

134
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,960
Speaker 0: And so now it has a crystalline matrix that holds it together.

135
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,340
Speaker 0: Of course, it can melt, but it will not fall back again into snow.

136
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,300
Speaker 0: It is now a block of a different quality.

137
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:38,420
Speaker 0: And so... I can go on at length about this nature of civilization, but what I would just say is something like examples of empire, of which neoliberalism is one.

138
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,000
Speaker 0: Rome was an empire.

139
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,580
Speaker 0: Obviously, the Chinese empires are empires.

140
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:49,360
Speaker 0: And what you see with empire is that empire takes nation as its feedstock.

141
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,800
Speaker 0: Empire takes nations, and it does two things to them.

142
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,360
Speaker 0: It decontextualizes them.

143
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:11,980
Speaker 0: So it breaks apart their qualities of relationality and brings persons into individuals and then relates individuals by means of the body of the institutional forms of the civilization.

144
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:23,700
Speaker 0: And a simple example that we're all familiar with in the body of neoliberalism is you no longer go to your family's house to have a meal.

145
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,600
Speaker 0: You go to a restaurant.

146
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:32,740
Speaker 0: where there's a bunch of people that are serving food to each other, entirely mediated by the body of money and to a lesser extent by law.

147
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:40,240
Speaker 0: And so the layer that connects people is always intermediated by the body of the civilization.

148
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,800
Speaker 0: That's what holds the people together as a kind of group.

149
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:54,980
Speaker 0: Whereas, of course, if you go to your family's house for Easter dinner, the bond that holds you together is shared deep relationships of intimacy.

150
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,180
Speaker 0: and a shared common spirit, which in this case would be Christ.

151
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,400
Speaker 0: It's Easter.

152
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,140
Speaker 0: It could also just be family if you're secular.

153
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,980
Speaker 0: And so we can iterate.

154
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,800
Speaker 0: We can zoom in on a given empire or a given other form of civilization.

155
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,200
Speaker 0: From my point of view, these are the same.

156
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:22,340
Speaker 0: And so we can deconstruct how modernity is a particular advanced form of empire.

157
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:38,700
Speaker 0: of civilization and neoliberalism we can speak to why it is that when neoliberalism breaks that i'm proposing that civilization states are more stable and we'll see them rise but then why i would see that they will also find themselves to be destabilized this is a two-step process not one step

158
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:58,640
Speaker 1: okay uh let's stop here for a moment if you don't mind like with this to distinguish because i think it's kind of here where the main disagreement would be like or with no disagreement, but just let me a little bit challenge this by first one observation.

159
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:06,260
Speaker 1: I think the key point you brought in talking about nation is the point of common spirit.

160
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:19,180
Speaker 1: And what I see is like that any type of unity doesn't matter whether you call it nation or doesn't matter you call it family.

161
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,500
Speaker 1: or whether you call it civilization, or a cult, or anything else, is maintained by a common spirit.

162
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:37,020
Speaker 1: Like even coercion and incentives, they don't function without the context of common spirit or common ethical system.

163
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:41,180
Speaker 1: You can basically... Easy way to understand spirit is a relationship.

164
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:41,800
Speaker 1: Exactly.

165
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:51,040
Speaker 1: So I really like you brought the idea of relationship, because effectively a relationship... You can say the quality of relationship between us is the spirit between us.

166
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,540
Speaker 1: Like it won't be too far stretch, let's say, to just use it linguistically.

167
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:03,240
Speaker 1: So for any unity to keep itself for any period of time, you need a spirit.

168
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,880
Speaker 1: Like you need a common spirit.

169
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:13,200
Speaker 1: Like any historian of civilizations would say that even coercion and incentive without the common meta-interpretational scheme don't function.

170
00:25:13,660 --> 00:26:16,060
Speaker 1: like they can function very short period of time but you cannot build neither civilization nor empire based upon it like uh it always has to be some form of sometimes it's common idea uh sometimes it can be very let's say personalistic idea let's you can see like say empire of alexander like really like big empire like but kind of clearly united by the spirit of alexander with the death of alexander collapses into let's say bigger pieces that's why i think like which kind of most civilizational approaches and studies it doesn't matter whether it's russian or pretty like point beyond the nalewski kind of hunting and details matter but the general understanding the leaning towards is like a big religious um unity uh blocks of unity and ethicals or at least ethical system which is derivative from this let's say block of unity Where I personally think neoliberalism was different was a different form of empire.

171
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,240
Speaker 1: And that's why I like your explanation in the beginning.

172
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:29,560
Speaker 1: It was an attempt to create an empire without direct appeal to the transcendent, which was very interesting.

173
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,920
Speaker 1: long experiment of 400 years.

174
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:38,240
Speaker 1: Ultimately, I think it's failing precisely because it cannot address this empty throne and its heart.

175
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,840
Speaker 1: So what's exactly the spirit we are worshipping?

176
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,360
Speaker 1: I can name it, for example.

177
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,160
Speaker 1: You can name it, but you cannot call it officially.

178
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:55,960
Speaker 1: You cannot put it in its proper place in your system of global governance, and as a result, you're losing this legitimacy and losing this authority, and it starts collapsing countries.

179
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,020
Speaker 1: In my opinion, it was the biggest weakness of neoliberalism.

180
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:58,500
Speaker 1: where i so where that's kind of thing so far we might be in agreement where i disagree is that empire or civilization is necessary babylon i think that's very important distinguish what i mean is like atomization in my opinion and my experience of studying empires like for example austro-hungarian empire or russian empire actually provide great sphere of diversities for what you call nations so i would prefer to call them peoples which i think is important distinguishing like like when we talk about it and surprisingly it's precisely only after a nation-state project which came into these regions you started to have the gigantic atomization and horrible, horrible massacres and blood conflicts on a scale unimagined under empires.

181
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:12,800
Speaker 1: For example, if you look at the ethnolinguistic map of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, you will see that there were Czechs living next to Germans, Borders living next to Czechs, Slovak-Hungarians, Croatians, etc.

182
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,160
Speaker 1: These are, in fact, my lineage.

183
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,020
Speaker 1: Yes, what you call lineage.

184
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,920
Speaker 0: No, no, no, my personal, my personal lineage.

185
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,860
Speaker 1: Oh, personal, sorry.

186
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,800
Speaker 0: From that era.

187
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:24,940
Speaker 1: Great, yeah.

188
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:40,780
Speaker 1: So you can see, it's precisely in the imperial context, these differences, there was a meta system of interpretation, which allowed their coexistence with each other without needing to pure itself from everybody who is not.

189
00:28:41,180 --> 00:30:12,700
Speaker 1: directly part of my blood relationship and that's the key foundational role of imperial authority of imperial monarchies if you want it it's an integral system of interpretation which allows smaller system of uh kinships to flourish there are two dangers here which you're absolutely right any empire can become too tyrannical and that's what you call about like let's say if if it starts valuing itself for its own self it's one important element to understand that no empire worth its salt historically exists for its own sake it exists either to serve this common ideal or let's say a common spirit in your context it can be orthodox ideal it can be muslim idea it can be chinese this heaven idea but point being it's serving this ideal and secondly it's not serving itself per se it's serving it for example you can call it greater good but for for a purpose which is not within the empire percent like it is also very tricky relationship where comes the danger and historically most often the danger coming it is but it's kind of the danger of any unity of you could say think about as a family unity processor the danger is like when hierarchy or or unity starts serving itself and not this telos the unity is embodying or representing Like, basically, it's, let's say, empire for empire's sake or kinship for kinship's sake or family for family's sake.

190
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:33,780
Speaker 1: If, let's say, two people in a family or, like, bigger people in a family are not united together in order to embody, let's say, the Christ in front of, like, Easter Orthodoxy, so, like, fine, this language, to embody something bigger than themselves, then it starts falling apart.

191
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:34,700
Speaker 1: One.

192
00:30:35,240 --> 00:31:06,100
Speaker 1: element of the swallowing apart is that every part becomes self-referential so it tries to break the unity and focus the unity on your own self or the authority structure becomes tyrannical and tries to suppress any diversity without uh you can call it unnecessary suppression because there is such as a necessary suppression your name is oppressive my name is oppressive like like any identity is oppressive in itself So there is a healthy, let's say, oppression, if you want to put it this way.

193
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,880
Speaker 1: But there is an unhealthy oppression when it's become self-referential and for its own sake.

194
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,840
Speaker 1: And yes, any hierarchy has a danger.

195
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:24,880
Speaker 1: The problem where I see it, like, if you completely abandon this higher calling for this or meta-referential structure, what I call empire.

196
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,940
Speaker 1: So just to clarify, what I call empire is not Babylon.

197
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:34,760
Speaker 1: What I call empire is any form of... worshipping the common spirit, ultimately.

198
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,740
Speaker 1: That's actually for my difference.

199
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:44,920
Speaker 1: So I think that any big historical, let's say, process or group or political group or cultural group has this element.

200
00:31:45,060 --> 00:32:29,360
Speaker 1: It either moves towards integration, and then through process of integration, it creates, through a common spirit, it can integrate different elements which are not... stimuli per se but they are similar in most important and this most important thing is precisely this common spirit uh or it kind of disappears or becomes part of other things because alternatively you have constantly the problem of violence which we will talk about it later but i'm talking a little bit too much but right now i'm curious to see to hear whether i managed to at least express my difference to this hypothesis you posed i

201
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:56,340
Speaker 0: i i think so i think so let me um i won't repeat back to you what i'll do is i'll resp i respond with what has come to me as a consequence so my hope and expectation is that we will actually cultivate deeper insight and right now i'm feeling like i've achieved a deeper level of insight as a result of what you're presenting so what i'm seeing is i think that's a three kinds of spirit

202
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,980
Speaker 1: okay so that's a good start yeah

203
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,360
Speaker 0: Three kinds of spirit.

204
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,540
Speaker 0: The first two are trouble.

205
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:11,320
Speaker 0: The first is in fact a proper spirit of a nation as assigned by the Lord after Babel.

206
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,620
Speaker 0: And notice that these are particular.

207
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:24,520
Speaker 0: So if I, who am not a member of your people, let's say, but in English would be translated nations, by the way, if you read the Bible in English.

208
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,260
Speaker 0: it is the nations that's where it's my connection

209
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:32,140
Speaker 1: in russians they're called languages like like that's even more interesting this is

210
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:57,380
Speaker 0: not a bad way of doing it that's not a bad way of doing it at all um so this is the very similar idea right but when you say mother tongue is maybe even better than language you and i are both speaking english it is not your mother's tongue it is my mother's tongue but it's not my mother's mother's mother's tongue interesting so if i participate in the spirit of your but it is not mine, then that's trouble.

211
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,060
Speaker 0: Okay?

212
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,820
Speaker 0: Now, what we see is we see some of the spirits seem to have a taste for that.

213
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:16,679
Speaker 0: Some of the spirits, not only do they seek to have their people worship them rather than worship God, they also seek to have more people brought under them than was apportioned to them properly.

214
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:17,880
Speaker 0: Okay?

215
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:19,320
Speaker 1: Sorry.

216
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,739
Speaker 1: I think even here you have two distinguishes.

217
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,120
Speaker 1: So some spirits have a tendency to bring other spirits to worship them.

218
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,520
Speaker 1: Like the second point you're talking about.

219
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,219
Speaker 1: And some have the idea of worshiping them instead of God.

220
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:42,159
Speaker 1: Like basically it's that idea of nation for nation's sake, leaving God's aside.

221
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,659
Speaker 1: You can put it this way, but it's two different process.

222
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,520
Speaker 1: Not all of them want to bring others.

223
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,360
Speaker 1: Some of them are pretty content with just worship me instead of a God.

224
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,460
Speaker 1: Like just to be clear, it's usually smaller nations.

225
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,340
Speaker 1: Just go on.

226
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:55,699
Speaker 0: Very nice.

227
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:07,640
Speaker 0: And so we see, for example, the continuous tendency of Baal to bring the people of Israel under his worship, which is wrong for both reasons, right?

228
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,940
Speaker 0: Not only is he pulling people from Israel from worshiping God, in this particular case, I'm sure he's also competing with Ashtaroth and everybody else, right?

229
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,760
Speaker 0: So it's this kind of mismatch.

230
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:44,900
Speaker 0: The second, and the second may be the... the first but there's a particular set so i'm thinking specifically of mammon there's a particular spirits that maybe never even properly had languages people's nations but have as their basic characteristic this vast breadth of of ways of getting people to worship them we've seen Moloch, right?

231
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:51,200
Speaker 0: But maybe Moloch is, you know, Moloch was in fact properly a particular spirit, but maybe he was actually always of this kind of mammon.

232
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,380
Speaker 0: This isn't, I'm not quite sure.

233
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,180
Speaker 0: These feel like they were never apportioned to people, but they still nonetheless have brought people to worship them.

234
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:04,200
Speaker 1: I think the two most, if you're using, comment, I love that you're using it.

235
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,680
Speaker 1: Like it's, I always feel.

236
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:29,800
Speaker 1: a little bit uncomfortable when i talk with people in this because but with you it sounds absolutely great about these names just calling them by what they are like i think the two most uh this uh why the breast is exactly mammoth and the second is basically uh the sexual righteousness prostitution and fem like dark femininity if you want to put it yeah

237
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,780
Speaker 0: yeah yeah very nice so

238
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:36,360
Speaker 1: like if you can see more one wing more dark masculinity Hebel being more dark femininity.

239
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,500
Speaker 1: There is even an element of this kind of parallel between them, but gauntlets.

240
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:49,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we see, for example, you might say that we see Mars shows up here, but he is also Ares.

241
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,140
Speaker 0: He has different names and different nations, and it's almost like you can see these characters running orthogonal.

242
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,260
Speaker 0: So you have the vertical nations and the horizontal dominations.

243
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,120
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll call them that.

244
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,780
Speaker 0: Dominions, probably is even a proper name.

245
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,320
Speaker 0: And then you have the third, right?

246
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:13,680
Speaker 0: And the third are proper spirits that on the one hand do not seek to bring under them that which is not properly under them.

247
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:21,040
Speaker 0: And on the other hand, always seek to be brought in their proper hierarchical relationship under the triune God.

248
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,480
Speaker 0: I think that formulation, which gets away from the kind of the more vernacular that I was forced to use earlier.

249
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,480
Speaker 1: And I think it's more clear.

250
00:37:30,120 --> 00:40:00,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can always translate it into vernacular term, let's stay here so far because it might be easier i think here what i want yes reframing my whole a little bit convoluted explanation what i guess coming to the nature what i wanted to say is uh even proper spirits are in hierarchy i think that's my biggest comment and where we disagree because you i don't know if you read it but there is this famous christian text one of the earliest and most difficult actually philosophical Christianity works about the heavenly hierarchy by Dionysius of Areopagus and yeah if you haven't read it okay good but just otherwise would have recommend and I think without going too much into details it's one important conclusion is like there is an improper hierarchy and there is a proper hierarchy what I let's say feel the big problem with even idea of the right particularities, right particularities, not you particular, but with the thought that sometimes I have even with good people this feeling that if we avoid playing hierarchical game at all, somehow in order to defend ourselves from improper hierarchy, it will save us, which for me and here you can call it my lineage my particularity or my historic example which for me i don't think it works i think that the only antidote for improper hierarchy is a proper hierarchy and not the absence of hierarchy per se and i think that's what kind of was the nature of my biggest tension uh my biggest comment which i was trying to convey the problem is like it's hard to keep a proper hierarchy first even if it's incredibly hard even to understand what a proper hierarchy is because there is this internal tension to just be misled let's say but by by other non-proper spirits but there is even a bigger problem and that's what i think is absolutely crucial to highlight and to be honest with as any traditionalist or conservative which i am and i have to admit that often it's the second element we tend to avoid that even what started as a proper hierarchy has an intrinsic, eternal, internal, eternal and internal danger of becoming an improper hierarchy the second it becomes self-referential.

251
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:10,380
Speaker 1: And the second it forgets that it's not for its own sake because ultimately to be a proper hierarchy you need to have the highest point of hierarchy to be the highest, the god.

252
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,040
Speaker 1: And yes, there is this internal challenge here.

253
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:18,380
Speaker 1: I would rather frame it that the bigger you become, even if you are a proper hierarchy.

254
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,920
Speaker 1: And there is actually an interesting tendency.

255
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,760
Speaker 1: Like if you are in a proper hierarchy, you will also grow.

256
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,740
Speaker 1: And that's why the kingdom of Israel, when it wasn't proper hierarchy, it grew.

257
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,840
Speaker 1: Like it didn't stay small.

258
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,380
Speaker 1: It grew.

259
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:36,320
Speaker 1: So you can grow improperly and you can through improper hierarchy and you can grow through proper hierarchy.

260
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,820
Speaker 1: The hierarchy itself presumes growth.

261
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:48,500
Speaker 1: Somehow, when you start arranging things in a certain order, this doubling effect you've been talking about in our previous conversation starts taking place.

262
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,260
Speaker 1: And one question is simple.

263
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,500
Speaker 1: If you're in a proper hierarchy, okay, it's clear where you end up.

264
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,840
Speaker 1: But there is even a trickier story, and Israel's story shows this.

265
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:09,000
Speaker 1: Even if you start as a proper hierarchy, if you don't meet up the challenge of becoming big, but keeping the proper hierarchy, you will collapse under your own because you start worshipping not the right spirit or start worshipping the spirits improperly.

266
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,480
Speaker 0: Yes, I think this is all very, very correct.

267
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,980
Speaker 0: And you can notice a variety of different diagnoses.

268
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:27,580
Speaker 0: A simple diagnosis would be the degree to which you say, no, this is mine, as opposed to, no, this is God's, and right now God has placed it under my stewardship.

269
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,740
Speaker 0: And if God chooses to place it elsewhere, that's where it should be.

270
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,360
Speaker 0: Very simple, like you notice that tension.

271
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,420
Speaker 0: But I think this is all actually quite right.

272
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:54,440
Speaker 0: So a way of saying it is something like, there has been a profound power of improper hierarchy under the name of neoliberalism, which is a version of the kind of construct that the adversary produces.

273
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,660
Speaker 0: That is in the process of imploding as it always will.

274
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,340
Speaker 0: This is important.

275
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,880
Speaker 0: improper hierarchy will always collapse.

276
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,260
Speaker 0: As that happens, we will see a number of things occur.

277
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:17,080
Speaker 0: One, we will begin to see the aliveness.

278
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:24,240
Speaker 0: The aliveness of proper hierarchy is beautiful because it's like the light that cannot be put out by the darkness.

279
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:41,880
Speaker 0: And so when the darkness finally begins to break you will see these points of light and you'll begin to see them again and and life will begin to reorient towards that more uh correctly and so you'll begin to see them brighter so we will see that by the way this is my my proposition

280
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:42,460
Speaker 1: yes

281
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:52,180
Speaker 0: the second is more complicated um the second has to do with the distinction the challenge between the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of this world

282
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:52,500
Speaker 1: um

283
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:02,460
Speaker 0: and the and the embodiment of how people are able to be in relationship in communion.

284
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,260
Speaker 0: This is very tough.

285
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,420
Speaker 0: Let me see if I can even step into that.

286
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:09,960
Speaker 0: So let's see.

287
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,040
Speaker 0: I will do this.

288
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,640
Speaker 0: I will be very, very banal to begin.

289
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,000
Speaker 0: So we have conditions of orality.

290
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,680
Speaker 0: We have conditions of walking speed.

291
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,560
Speaker 0: Just think about this.

292
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,260
Speaker 0: Just use communication as the basis.

293
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,140
Speaker 0: Communion and communication are close.

294
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:53,300
Speaker 0: When you and I are afforded a possibility of being in relationship only by means either that I walk to where you are or you walk to where I am or some third person walks to where you are and then carries your message to me.

295
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,700
Speaker 0: produces an affordance of a certain possibility of embodiment.

296
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,860
Speaker 0: This is very important.

297
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:15,740
Speaker 0: The qualities of our relationship and the kinds of communication that we in fact have available to us produce a certain moment of embodiment under both improper and proper hierarchies.

298
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:24,600
Speaker 0: Now, interestingly, this phase How does this work?

299
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,680
Speaker 0: So this stage, this stage of orality, when I say orality, I mean also by foot.

300
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,520
Speaker 0: There's for me connected right now.

301
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,740
Speaker 0: We'll tend to be also very genetic kin.

302
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,160
Speaker 0: Yes.

303
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,880
Speaker 0: You'll tend obviously to live near the people who you were born with for lots of reasons.

304
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,060
Speaker 1: Yeah.

305
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,240
Speaker 0: And so then this is why, and you will have your language will be shared because they're all, in fact, your mother's tongue.

306
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,660
Speaker 0: You learn them from your mother who learned them for her mother.

307
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,960
Speaker 0: So this has the difficulty of self-referentiality, which we, of course, have seen, like crazy.

308
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,000
Speaker 0: It has less difficulty of tyranny.

309
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:03,600
Speaker 0: let's say.

310
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,480
Speaker 0: And by tyranny, what I mean is grabbing people who do not belong under a spirit and bringing them under that spirit.

311
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,940
Speaker 0: It does, but much less.

312
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:16,940
Speaker 0: We have just the classic example, like we go to the people next to us, we capture some of them, and we ingest them into us as slaves.

313
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,040
Speaker 0: That's what that looks like at that level.

314
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,480
Speaker 1: And by the way, it kills the men and keeps the women and children, yes.

315
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,120
Speaker 1: Classic story.

316
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,800
Speaker 0: This appears to be interesting, right?

317
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,060
Speaker 0: It just seems to be very, very endemic of that stage.

318
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,700
Speaker 0: But it has these problems and these possibilities.

319
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:32,600
Speaker 0: Okay.

320
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,160
Speaker 0: Then I can write it down.

321
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,220
Speaker 0: Now we move and I can write something down.

322
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,660
Speaker 0: So now no longer am I mediated by the same technique.

323
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,160
Speaker 0: Maybe I also have horses, some more distance.

324
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,060
Speaker 0: Notice how this changes the possibilities of embodiment.

325
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,940
Speaker 0: It increases certain scope, certain capacities.

326
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,100
Speaker 0: Now perhaps I also have a ledger so I can keep relationships of debt.

327
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,140
Speaker 0: So now I don't have to kill all the men.

328
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,380
Speaker 0: and capture the women, I could just put everybody in debt.

329
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,500
Speaker 0: And they are now, their will is subordinated to my will in a way that is much more subtle.

330
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,860
Speaker 0: By the way, the perfection of this neoliberalism is not lost on me.

331
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,900
Speaker 0: So there's subtlety, there's speed, there's distance.

332
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:24,920
Speaker 0: And the point that I think I'm getting to is that, and that I'd like to sort of have us spend some time on is, Funny.

333
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,440
Speaker 0: If you think back to what I was mentioning at the beginning, we're in a portal.

334
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,060
Speaker 0: We're in a transition.

335
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:47,980
Speaker 0: We're moving from the moment where the defining characteristic of the material conditions of communication, of our relationality, were defined by television, the printing press, and airplanes and cars.

336
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,940
Speaker 0: There was kind of the envelope that governed our possibilities.

337
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,160
Speaker 1: I think we would just call combustion.

338
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,460
Speaker 1: Combustion, yes.

339
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,980
Speaker 0: And boats as well, yeah.

340
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,260
Speaker 0: To this new one, which we are now.

341
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:15,780
Speaker 0: This is a different possibility where the primary, or not the primary, but a powerful possibility for our relationality is by the new governance of this digital meta-medium.

342
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,820
Speaker 0: And I want to make sure we hold that.

343
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,720
Speaker 0: Meta-medium.

344
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:19,580
Speaker 1: Okay.

345
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:28,300
Speaker 0: Because prior to the digital, all media were bound to their form.

346
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,500
Speaker 0: And this produced a lot of their signature characteristics.

347
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:42,960
Speaker 0: So broadcast television, analog broadcast television, is television and it's broadcast.

348
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,480
Speaker 0: And these both matter.

349
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:53,400
Speaker 0: Broadcastness is centralized and asymmetric by necessity.

350
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,180
Speaker 0: It's impossible to do it otherwise.

351
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,500
Speaker 0: Television is audiovisual and fantastic.

352
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:00,740
Speaker 0: It's a phantasm.

353
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,400
Speaker 0: It's an illusion.

354
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,040
Speaker 0: It's a dream.

355
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,720
Speaker 0: This is not the same as analog text.

356
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,460
Speaker 0: A book is a different kind of thing.

357
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,380
Speaker 0: Newspaper is a different kind of thing.

358
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,360
Speaker 0: Digital is anything.

359
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:21,060
Speaker 0: Right now, we're happening to do something like audiovisual symmetric digital.

360
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,920
Speaker 0: For those who watch this, it's audiovisual asymmetric digital.

361
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:33,500
Speaker 0: But if I wrote it down, it would be text asymmetric digital, unless we were talking to each other.

362
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,200
Speaker 0: You see how that works?

363
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:38,440
Speaker 0: Digital is the ultimate of all possible media.

364
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:45,420
Speaker 0: It contains all of the possibility of media within it, but under the constraint, the very specific constraint of digitization.

365
00:48:46,500 --> 00:49:04,140
Speaker 0: So when we analyze this form, this will give us some insight into what is the new possibilities, risks of how proper and improper communion, what was the word we were using earlier?

366
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,340
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

367
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,800
Speaker 1: Let me throw one thought here, like, while you were talking about digital.

368
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:21,540
Speaker 1: I think you can, like, the biggest danger, and it's biggest boon you can put it this way, it's the same thing.

369
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:35,020
Speaker 1: And the problem is that digital, you can call it, it's the most natural environmental for this spirit.

370
00:49:35,540 --> 00:50:05,440
Speaker 1: we've been talking about to exist to communicate and to commune people with and i can even reframe it into like digital is what uh spirits makes out of it that's what i mean like no matter what we do like precisely in the matter form of our conversation the spirit of this conversation will stay the same like you've been talking about let's say Sorry.

371
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,300
Speaker 1: Okay.

372
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:07,660
Speaker 1: Not too far.

373
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:08,960
Speaker 0: No, good.

374
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,360
Speaker 0: Keep going.

375
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:09,560
Speaker 0: Yes.

376
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:14,400
Speaker 1: So just on a simple level, we've been talking about Mammon and Cybill.

377
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:26,020
Speaker 1: Well, Instagram, no matter whether you put it in video, text, form, photo, AI, adapted photo, translated, the spirit of the communication stays the same.

378
00:50:27,060 --> 00:51:25,200
Speaker 1: And why I mean it's dangerous because... truth be told one of the biggest prices of modernity and conscious effort of modernity and neoliberalism in particular it's precisely make it made us very defenseless against this sort of spiritual struggle and it's very i think the biggest danger of the current moment like of a collapse of one improper hierarchy and is that it's not just there will be some shining lights of new proper hierarchies and just in case it will be very unpleasant moment when this light can point to shine like and that's people are not prepared for it but i think the most inherent danger in this moment precisely because of this meta quality of new environment is to create the improper hierarchy it's like you know this improper hierarchy didn't work well because it was too constrained It was still constrained by many things we considered important.

379
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,200
Speaker 1: Let's unconstrained it.

380
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:33,880
Speaker 1: And here, actually, this whole AI thing you talked about, that's what I find truly complicated.

381
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:44,160
Speaker 1: Because, yes, ultimately, because even though I personally, but we already defined what I mean by empire.

382
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:48,260
Speaker 1: So generally, I think empire as a proper hierarchy can be a really good thing.

383
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,200
Speaker 1: And that's why I think.

384
00:51:49,560 --> 00:53:19,540
Speaker 1: in a proper empire the heart of a proper empire is a common sacred language vernacular languages can be very different but within the heart of every empire single is the same sacred language and the sacred it represents for example you can say for orthodox it's like church so for russian it's church slavonic for let's say catholics it was latin and for chinese it's chinese but that's exactly for hinduism it would be sanskrit but sacred languages the role of sacred languages it's in a proper empire but what if in a new digital environment amidst of all chaos of the collapsing of biggest let's say old 400 year old idol we've been worshiping and sacrificing for generations the pain of its collapse will be tremendous and the technical capabilities to create new meta idol are enormous and something tells me there will be a lot of interplay here i just would not call it imperial to me it's not about it's kind of to me it's like to me it's more basically i wouldn't call world government an empire let me put it this way like i think that's kind of the biggest to me it's like there are four levels not three so to me there is this level of what you call what you call nation so good particularities then there is the level of nation states like what what is traditionally understood as nation states then there is a level of empire what civilization And then there is a super high level.

385
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,100
Speaker 1: There is a fourth hidden level.

386
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:31,620
Speaker 1: But I find out that historically, actually, empire and first and third level, actually, most part of the history worked in a pretty good relationship with each other.

387
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:39,280
Speaker 1: Like empire doesn't need to, like historically, like even let's say, again, I brought historical examples from Europe, but even before.

388
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,980
Speaker 1: like great level of diversity.

389
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:51,360
Speaker 1: The challenge of nation-state is precisely the exception of nation-state which doesn't like diversity at all, because it precisely defines its political legitimacy through very strong particularities.

390
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:58,360
Speaker 1: That's why you suddenly have problems about which languages people use, how people use these languages, unification processes, even within all societies.

391
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,240
Speaker 1: For example, France.

392
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,120
Speaker 1: You can take France.

393
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:12,840
Speaker 1: Like before French moved into like the nation-state model in the 19th century, lots of different regional dialects without There was a common meta-narrative which allowed people to communicate, but it was very different.

394
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:20,820
Speaker 1: French state came, nationalist state came, gigantic unifications, provinces divided into small municipalities, not organic, very artificial.

395
00:54:21,260 --> 00:55:17,440
Speaker 1: That's why I noticed this nation-state in a traditional understanding, at least within political theory, is actually an enemy of small particularities and equally the smaller of... let's say i would call them organic more organic hierarchies because any empire worth of salt ultimately ends up also being relational usually they are formed through marriages through let's say dynastic marriages and then through different systems of integration but it's not what we're talking about i think the key problem is the question of this force level and i think that ultimately we again have a choice ultimately sold choice so again from apocalypse we know kind of more or less how it's end but Either all of these civilizations, like the proper organized empires, the sacralities, through one process or another, understood that and embrace one God, like Jesus Christ in that sense, let's say as a Christian.

396
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:23,580
Speaker 1: So they understand that there is an integral hierarchy behind their integral hierarchy.

397
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:29,360
Speaker 1: And yes, technically for Christian civilization seems easier and it seems more unfair for non-Christian civilization.

398
00:55:30,380 --> 00:56:26,000
Speaker 1: simply the single point of attention in either it will be the true single point of attention or alternatively it will be a simulacrum of this point of attention and this simulacrum is what i think partially is represented in apocalypses by antichrist like how we will integrate empire and and the argument will always be the same argument the key argument will be about peace and security like the key argument to bring this improv even either to distort a proper hierarchy or to bring a proper hierarchy together will always be what you call coercion and incentive well yeah like peace and security ultimately false i would just qualify that it's false peace and security it's not that peace and security are bad per se but it's false peace and false security when you have to sacrifice to them the most important that's the problem

399
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:32,240
Speaker 0: yes Let me make a list of things on the left-hand side and things on the right-hand side.

400
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:36,160
Speaker 0: So on the left-hand side, you have persons.

401
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,220
Speaker 0: On the right-hand side, you have individuals.

402
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:42,580
Speaker 0: On the left-hand side, you have communities in communion.

403
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,320
Speaker 0: On the right-hand side, you have societies.

404
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:51,060
Speaker 0: I think I've been able to articulate five or six of these, and I think in each case we see it.

405
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,420
Speaker 0: And of course, the point is you sacrifice.

406
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,640
Speaker 0: Oh, on the left-hand side, you have life.

407
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,720
Speaker 0: On the right-hand side, you have survival.

408
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:04,100
Speaker 0: So sacrifice life to achieve survival, which means you don't become alive, you become undead.

409
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,360
Speaker 0: You're a zombie or a vampire.

410
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,560
Speaker 0: So these are the separations that occur.

411
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,820
Speaker 0: And this is what is on offer.

412
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,120
Speaker 0: You're offered life or you're offered survival.

413
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:20,680
Speaker 0: You're offered the opportunity to be a proper person in relationship with a trinity of persons.

414
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,540
Speaker 0: or you have the offer to be an individual under what is in fact an individual.

415
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,760
Speaker 0: So I would put this as a new heuristic.

416
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:39,120
Speaker 0: The thing that will be offered that is not the triune God, we'll have to be very precise on that, will actually also be a singleton.

417
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,100
Speaker 0: It will be single.

418
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,140
Speaker 0: Singleness will be one of the signs of the Antichrist.

419
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:58,440
Speaker 0: Because it is only truly under that which is intrinsically unity and multiplicity simultaneously that any proper hierarchical subordination makes any sense at all.

420
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,420
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

421
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,800
Speaker 1: And that's kind of what we've been talking about.

422
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,400
Speaker 1: Any proper hierarchy is about it.

423
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:17,260
Speaker 1: Because the trick, not the trick, I think the key purpose of any proper hierarchy, and that's kind of the problem it tries to answer, is the problem like... Correct me if I'm wrong.

424
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,180
Speaker 1: I'm curious to see what you say.

425
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:29,840
Speaker 1: But it's an attempt to keep movement because life is movement and there is an intrinsic connection between movement and life.

426
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:34,040
Speaker 1: But also there is an intrinsic connection between movement and death.

427
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,780
Speaker 1: There is movement and there is entropy.

428
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:45,320
Speaker 1: And I think that any proper hierarchy really tries through integration towards something which is true and life.

429
00:58:46,060 --> 00:59:12,600
Speaker 1: and then yeah you can we can disagree and you can be in mistake what it is but i would say most of their proper hierarchies at least try to go to this direction they're trying to keep this movement element but to limit at least the entropy element and that's what exactly this dynamic between unity and multiplicity but there is movement within us And it keeps us alive.

430
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,000
Speaker 1: But there is always us as a unity.

431
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,400
Speaker 1: And this unity prevents us from the movement which breaks us apart.

432
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,720
Speaker 1: And that's what I think is kind of dense.

433
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,700
Speaker 1: And obviously there are two ways of destroying it.

434
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,680
Speaker 1: One way of destroying it is to kill all the movement inside.

435
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,960
Speaker 1: And that's what you would call this tyrannical oppressive element nature.

436
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,800
Speaker 1: And there is the danger of just, okay, there is no unity and we just separate and fall apart.

437
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,660
Speaker 1: And to destroy hierarchy per se.

438
00:59:40,460 --> 01:01:37,260
Speaker 1: historically that this exactly this self-repeating process which is keep on keep on keep on happening the only true element which that's why i think trinitarian partners like absolute even from to say political scientists or politics or any any type of unity that understands because it's precisely the kind of what was shown to us actually we didn't came up with it we couldn't invent it like we couldn't really understand it that there is a possibility for movement because there is a constant movement of love within the trinity and uh there is still keeping this individuality element like not individuality but personality like it's exactly in english it's personality so yeah that's that's the tricky part and yeah i think without understanding it we will fall into one or two traps and that just but i think why i'm still hammering down an empire point i just want to exactly here again repeat this idea that it's almost it's unescapable choice of hierarchies i guess that's what i mean uh and especially i think now with this meter mediums and media technologies there can be a short point but then it will start reappearing even quicker because there is an inherent element of uh yeah you can call it power involved any hierarchy and that and that's i think the most scary part any hierarchy even bad hierarchy has a lot more power than non-hierarchy and you can't escape this challenge i think i think there is inherent danger when we're talking about nations for the sake of nations per se or like let's say mothers mother tongues etc as i as i already said it's that we are really trying to sometimes avoid the questions of a proper hierarchy it's like trying to stop the movement let's say i'm stopping the movement on my mother's stripe I'm staying in my tribe and nothing else exists beside my tribe.

439
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:38,980
Speaker 1: Problem is, it exists.

440
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:45,300
Speaker 1: And you will have to face the world outside of your tribe.

441
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:46,800
Speaker 0: Yes, yes.

442
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:48,260
Speaker 0: This is very nice.

443
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,320
Speaker 0: So I agree.

444
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,660
Speaker 0: I do not disagree at all.

445
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:54,180
Speaker 0: The distinction is between proper hierarchy and improper hierarchy.

446
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,660
Speaker 0: And you can see it, as you said, just at the level of family.

447
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,220
Speaker 0: So I have cousins.

448
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:01,840
Speaker 0: It is simply reality.

449
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,860
Speaker 0: I have second cousins and I have third cousins.

450
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,980
Speaker 0: It is simply what it is.

451
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,960
Speaker 0: And there are moments where not only do I have to be in relationship with them, but actually the opposite is true.

452
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:14,560
Speaker 0: It is optimal for me to be able to be in relationship with them.

453
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:16,160
Speaker 0: It is at the best if I can.

454
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,640
Speaker 0: So the question is, how do we cultivate the proper relationality?

455
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:23,640
Speaker 1: You gave the answer already.

456
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,440
Speaker 1: How we do it.

457
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:27,980
Speaker 1: So worshipping is a common thing.

458
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,740
Speaker 1: That's the only true answer.

459
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:37,100
Speaker 1: Any kind of this relationality can function precisely only through a common ethical sacred framework.

460
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,080
Speaker 1: I think it's an escapable part of it.

461
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:40,620
Speaker 1: Yes.

462
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,340
Speaker 0: And I find this.

463
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:57,340
Speaker 0: So the church is the embodiment whereby diversity of lineage can be brought into a whole integration that is more beautiful and contains no tyranny.

464
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:59,660
Speaker 0: That's not how the church always shows up.

465
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,060
Speaker 0: Or if you'd like, I can say capital C and lowercase c, but you get the distinction.

466
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,040
Speaker 0: And maybe we could do the same thing with empire.

467
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:12,460
Speaker 0: I have not had in my mind an experience of the word empire that is not mapped to tyranny.

468
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,300
Speaker 0: My world model does not have that.

469
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:30,580
Speaker 0: But if you describe an empire and say there is an empire that is a proper hierarchy, where the higher is a higher and it integrates the lower in a way that is... orienting all to the highest and is never using tyranny to do so

470
01:03:31,480 --> 01:04:23,440
Speaker 1: then again as an ideal model i think it well i'm glad we agree on it like here comes the problem what you described is i think how an empire should be and ultimately yes there is a problem that i am absolutely certain it will never happen in history like i think this type of empire you are talking about is an effect of heavenly jerusalem like what you are talking about so i'm i'm i understand that it won't happen to a proper extent there will always be sometimes more tyranny than necessary or sometimes more disintegration as you would like and the price of piling always comes like there is the wages of sin is death so if you're doing too much if an empire you are losing the sacred point and you're using too much tyranny on element there will blood will be spilled like so history is a very violent teacher like you always kind of play pay is a blood price

471
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:51,400
Speaker 0: one second i just realized something so part of this may also just be literally the fact that i'm from the west and you're from east because i have no problem with this image in the context of king okay i can i can imagine a wide variety of kings who are good kings and by that what i mean is they are fundamentally Their sovereignty is A, fully derivative from Christ, and B, is oriented towards the wholeness of the body.

472
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:58,900
Speaker 0: And so they are there to protect and maintain the integrity of the wholeness and have no particular self-referentiality.

473
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,400
Speaker 0: I have many images of these kinds of kings.

474
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,380
Speaker 0: This does not cause me any sense of discomfort to imagine this as being a possibility.

475
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,120
Speaker 0: Of course, I have many images of bad kings, too.

476
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,180
Speaker 0: That's not them.

477
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,960
Speaker 0: Not vaguely naive, but the point is that conceptually both work for me.

478
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:21,560
Speaker 0: So I have always just, whenever I've imagined empire, I've imagined empire as being something that is doing too much.

479
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:26,340
Speaker 0: You know, Caesar, the Roman Empire, the Babylonian Empire, the Chinese Empires.

480
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,300
Speaker 0: I see these empires that are that.

481
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:38,900
Speaker 0: But if I can imagine one that is just a king of kings, like a king that acts like a king and has more kings underneath, of course, this is a beautiful possibility.

482
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:39,340
Speaker 1: Okay, good.

483
01:05:40,840 --> 01:06:12,540
Speaker 1: I'm glad by the end we're kind of coming to it because just to miss when I say about when I speak about empire is something positive it's exactly about the king of kings model like it's not the one tyrannical it's not a Nabuchadnezzar oppressive everybody worships this idol please so to an extent it has internal element like yes here comes a problem like not every culture not every civilization like by the act of worshiping this idol like we have to believe that their intentions can also be good.

484
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,360
Speaker 1: In a sense, they might believe that it's a true god.

485
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,620
Speaker 1: And then you can see this problem and pattern emerges.

486
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:24,320
Speaker 1: And again, historical process, if you want to call it, it's the process of figuring it out through pain.

487
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,280
Speaker 1: Let me put it this way.

488
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:28,560
Speaker 1: Because if you are worshipping improper idols, sooner or later it will betray you.

489
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:37,520
Speaker 1: There is a very easy way to understand how you are worshipping something proper or something improper, sometimes in the short run, but historically in the long run.

490
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:44,000
Speaker 1: If you're worshipping something proper, if you're uniting your multiplicities against something proper, you will get more life.

491
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,340
Speaker 1: If you're worshipping something improper, you will get more death.

492
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:58,420
Speaker 1: And any improper worship or any improper goal is a goal which devours you by you getting closer to it.

493
01:06:58,580 --> 01:08:44,819
Speaker 1: And you can think about alcohol, drugs, but also like... anything so you're moving towards them you're getting something but in the end it devours you so it's it's any kind of bad spirit about it but yeah when i mean speak by empire is just like this level of integration higher and just you know when suddenly kings let's say small kings realize that there is something bigger which unites that can unite them integrally and let's say then they move into this bigger stage and when you're speaking about roman empire it is it is interesting historically would just not right now it would be interesting to speak even like how you see it and how you understand because there is only this mixture of proper improper and there is like again in the west yes there is an element of his historiographical prediction which i would say is way more negative to him because it's the opposition is empire versus democracy which again in my opinion if you read authentic greeks and roman sources you get way different image from both like it's very important exercise to have but maybe it's a topic for another time i think we really managed by then to us to pinpoint like really important uh nails into this into this wall of conversation and maybe open a way for some to start thinking about it because i think it is a key problem i think it's precisely because we are entering this moment when this one improper hierarchy will fall even though as we are front around us i would still say majority of people uh think somehow it will go on like i feel very sorry for them and like i emotionally can understand that because like i don't want it to collapse because like then it's terrifying what will come after it and it will be pretty terrifying but there is no way for it it is collapsing The real problem is what comes after collapse.

494
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:45,899
Speaker 1: And that's what I think.

495
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,479
Speaker 0: So let's just, maybe if you don't mind, maybe to finish on just that last piece.

496
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:55,819
Speaker 0: So there is, one can be in three states now.

497
01:08:56,819 --> 01:09:03,500
Speaker 0: One state is a state of denial, where you try to avoid thinking about the fact that it's going to be collapsing.

498
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:14,500
Speaker 0: The second state is the state of addiction, where you're trying to move from one collapsing improper hierarchy to another improper hierarchy.

499
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,920
Speaker 0: In this case, typically up towards the AI overlord, something like that.

500
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:24,000
Speaker 0: The third is healing.

501
01:09:24,979 --> 01:09:33,960
Speaker 0: The third is where you are allowing the collapse to reawaken your connection to the proper hierarchy, which will be a lot of work because you probably aren't there right now.

502
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,819
Speaker 0: You may have to do both in your body, your relationships, and in your soul.

503
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:56,480
Speaker 0: a shift to bring yourself closer to the center of your proper place and of course in this case very critically to bring yourself under the king the true king uh who will then help you bring you to your proper place so step by step and then the then the good things can begin to happen

504
01:09:57,520 --> 01:11:02,780
Speaker 1: it's wonderful i just want kind of to add not the first stage but it's kind of very intermediate position it's like you don't want the first two options but you don't really understand that the third option exists it's just from my experience there is a lot of people who are also stuck a little bit into this moment and that's why i think conversations exactly like this are important even they can be banal for people for people who already let's say moved to the third stage it's needed sometimes a little bit important to keep in mind that that we spent 400 years in a very particular linguistic model of language it really limited even the possibilities of proper like of many proper hierarchies we just don't see them imaginable or many improper hierarchies we see as self-evident and the only way around it so I would say there is this force category of people who are not truly in denial or like subconsciously they already accepted it but they simply lost there is a force category of seeking and lost and seeking something like this And in the sense that we all are.

505
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:09,820
Speaker 0: And agents of the first three will be trying to figure out how to track people from the fourth.

506
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:10,840
Speaker 0: Absolutely, yes.

507
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,860
Speaker 1: And that, I think, is the struggle which is happening right now, ultimately.

508
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,120
Speaker 0: Very nice.

509
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,240
Speaker 0: Okay, good.

510
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,260
Speaker 1: Well, as always, gigantic pleasure to speak with you.

511
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,980
Speaker 1: Hope more to come.

512
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,660
Speaker 1: I think there is many points I would want to discuss with you further.

513
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,180
Speaker 1: But so far, thank you very much.

514
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,400
Speaker 1: Thank you very much for your time.

515
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:29,580
Speaker 0: Wonderful.

516
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:33,620
Speaker 0: Yes, I always look forward to seeing your messages, your name shown in my email box.

517
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,420
Speaker 1: Well, beware of your design.

518
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:38,480
Speaker 0: All right.

519
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:38,980
Speaker 0: Goodbye.

520
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,160
Speaker 0: Goodbye.
