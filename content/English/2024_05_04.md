I interview Richard Rohlin, scholar of symbolism, philologist and co-host of the Amon SÃ»l podcast.
We started the conversation about two key symbols of Universal History - the Tower of Babel and the Leviathan.
We explore how they are both rooted in "the" problem of political theory - "unity and multiplicity" and how the solutions they offer created the modern world.
We also talk about Church as the other way of understanding of the Unity and multiplicity problem.
