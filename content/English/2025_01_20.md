What age are we living in?
Nothing less than the time of the crisis of everything!
At least, that’s the idea eloquently presented by today’s guest, Jordan Hall, with wisdom and insight.
We discussed what makes and breaks a civilization, what a city truly is, why it may be dying—potentially forever—and why there can be no community without communion.
Enjoy!
