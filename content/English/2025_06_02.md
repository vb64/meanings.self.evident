In this episode, Pavel Shchelin and Jordan Hall explore how civilizations rise and fall not merely on power or technology, but on worship.
They discuss the false promise of modernity, the idolatry of the State, and the collapse of liberalism’s metaphysical foundations.
True order, they argue, requires not just networks and structures, but sacred symbols — a reorientation from technique to liturgy.
Only a civilization that knows Whom it serves can endure the coming storms.
