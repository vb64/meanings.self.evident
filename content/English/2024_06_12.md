I interview Richard Rohlin, scholar of symbolism, philologist and co-host of the Amon SÃ»l podcast.
It is the second part of which builds upon the topics of unitity and multiplicity we discussed during the previous conversation about the Tower of Babel and the Leviathan.
We continue exploration of how different Stories preserved in Tradition (of Thomas the Twin to name one) explain the inner theology of the pattern of Reform that created the modern world.
