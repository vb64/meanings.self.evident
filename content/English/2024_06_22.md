I present to your attention an interview with a man who probably needs no introduction, the most profound Western symbolist of our time, Orthodox iconographer,
creator of the Symbolic World project - Jonathan Pageau.

For me, this is the most voluminous conversation about the most basic issues underlying the matter of my study - political philosophy.
We discussed a wide range of topics: from the end of the Enlightenment to the return of Universal History;
from the dreams of Thomas Hobbes and their fruits to the hopes and failures of the Modernity.
